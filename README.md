# "Eat Slow" V2: Recipe and Grocery List Generator

I started a Javascript bootcamp with Code Fellows in February of 2017. In order to do this, I left a full-time job, and the full-time salary that came with it. 

One of the first things that I had to figure out was how to eat on a budget, and make my meals stretch throughout the week. How did we do this? Meal Prep Sunday, with recipes gathered and a massive grocery shop trip on Sunday to prep for all of the meals of the week.

This inspired a simple, fun side project - what if I could build an app that would let us pick from our favorite recipes, autogenerate a shopping list and let us check off those items at the grocery store in real time as my husband and I divided and conquered? Thus, the "Eat Slow" grocery list generator was born.

## Tech Stack:
* HTML
* CSS & SCSS
* React & React Router
* Node

## Goals
- To redesign an app I'd previously designed in vanilla JS and CSS.
- To practice using problem solving with React, and using React components.
- To build something fun and simple that I would actually use.
- To practice SCSS design principles.

## Phases
1. Create buttons that would actually generate the grocery lists when a recipe is selected. (complete)
2. Allow multiple recipes to display on the same page, but not show the same recipe more than one time. (in progress)
3. Combine ingredients from multiple recipes into the same food item - for example, if Recipe 1 calls for 3 carrots and Recipe 2 calls for 5 carrots, the list should read "8 carrots", not two lines with 3 and 5 carrots, respectivly. 
4. Segment the full recipe list by ingredient categories, based on where they would be in a grocery store. Ex: Produce, dairy, canned goods, bread, etc.
5. Make the app visually pleasing and responsive, since the user will likely be using it on a phone. Measure of success?: I should be able to send this to my non-technical runner friend and have her use it happily at the store.

## Possible Eventual Stretch Goals
1. Sort recipes by vegetarian, meat, pasta, etc.
2. Include recommended weekly meal plans with the recipes
3. Allow users to search by ingredients, to find recipes they could use based on existing items in their fridge
